# Cash-Grab

You have the choice of playing the game on an easy, medium or hard level. This will vary the pop up time of the moles and the cash item. Once the level is selected, click the start button and you will have 30 seconds to accumulate the goal score, presently hardcoded as 500.
If you are successful in collecting enough points, you will move to the next level (there are 4). If you are not, you have the opportunity to use a heart for another try at the level. If you have no hearts left, you will be given the option to restart the game.
If you complete the game, and your score qualifies for the scoreboard, you can put your initials next to your score to be remembered (local storage).
At the end of the game you are invited to play again to compete against your own score, or any other ones saved on the scoreboard.
Enjoy!



This is my take on a group assignment while attending Midlands Code Camp. We were instructed to create a whack-a-mole game. But, smacking all those moles made me sad, so I made my own verson where you are penalized for hitting those adorable buggers.
I added levels (I am very proud of the buttons), 4 lives, changed the graphics, added the cash and mole pop up options, the preview and action bar on the bottom, the scoreboard at the end; really, I changed everything except the mole pop ups.
I worked on this a long time because by the time I finished one module, I learned how to do another better and I re-did that. I got very familiar with Greensock and animations, used 3D Paint and Canva (for SVG conversion). In the end, I figured since I am a junior developer, it's ok to have the program a bit messy, because I am still learning. It also proves I wrote it myself!
I am aware that Lighthouse testing rates my speed low, and I am sorry. If you have suggestions for me, I am WIDE OPEN to constructive critism! Help me be a better coder.
I do hope you enjoy playing the game. Try it on all hardness levels, use up all the hearts and restart the game. My only regret is that I don't have a cute animation at the end when you pass the game. 
But, I may have one in the future! Stay tuned.
