# Cash-Grab

You have the choice of playing the game on an easy, medium or hard level. This will vary the pop up time of the moles and the cash item. Once the level is selected, click the start button and you will have 30 seconds to accumulate the goal score, presently hardcoded as 500.
If you are successful in collecting enough points, you will move to the next level (there are 4). If you are not, you have the opportunity to use a heart for another try at the level. If you have no hearts left, you will be given the option to restart the game.
If you complete the game, and your score qualifies for the scoreboard, you can put your initials next to your score to be remembered (local storage).
At the end of the game you are invited to play again to compete against your own score, or any other ones saved on the scoreboard.
Enjoy!
